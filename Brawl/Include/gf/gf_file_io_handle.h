     * Some notes about read request behavior.
     * - IMPORTANT: The addr parameter is actually the heap address. These read methods will *always* alloc your
     *   buffer for you, and I believe it is the caller's responsiblity to delete it.
     * - I'm not sure why but readRequest would hang and not ever return the correct isReady().
     *   I'm not sure if its because in my testing I was trying to read a file that I had just
     *   written, but I had no issues using readRequestNoSync. readRequestCached I did not test.
     * - The read() method is a synchronous variant of readRequestNoCached with a thread sleep loop. Nice.
     * - Setting length to 0 will read the whole file.
     * - The lengths here are in bytes.
     * - The lengths are a minimum length to read, not a maximum. If your file is too small, the read will
     *   fail. If you are worried about file size, I would probably use CheckFileSizeRequest or something along
     *   those lines. That's what the read() calls do internally.
     * - Using a filepath like "sd:/foo/bar" works.
